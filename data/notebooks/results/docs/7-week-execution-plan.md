## Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1 — Project Setup & Scope Refinement
**Objective:** Establish a strong foundation for implementation.  
**Key Activities:**
- Review Part A proposal and refine scope to an achievable MVP
- Set up Google Colab environment and required Python libraries
- Create and configure GitHub repository structure for collaboration
- Assign team roles and define weekly contribution responsibilities
- Document initial setup with screenshots and repository commits

**Deliverables/Evidence:**
- Scope refinement statement
- Google Colab notebook created
- GitHub repository established with folder structure
- Initial commits and contribution tracking

---

### Week 2 — Synthetic Data Design & Generation
**Objective:** Create a structured and realistic dataset for analysis and modelling.  
**Key Activities:**
- Define dataset schema (checkout journey variables and target label)
- Generate synthetic dataset using Python (CSV format)
- Validate dataset quality and ensure logical relationships
- Upload dataset and scripts to GitHub for version control

**Deliverables/Evidence:**
- Dataset schema documentation
- Synthetic dataset file (`.csv`)
- Data generation notebook/script and Git commits

---

### Week 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Funnel Analysis
**Objective:** Identify patterns and drop-off points in checkout behaviour.  
**Key Activities:**
- Conduct funnel analysis across key steps (e.g., cart → checkout → payment → purchase)
- Perform EDA to understand variable distribution and abandonment trends
- Visualise insights using charts (bar plots, box plots, funnel charts)
- Document early findings in clear business language

**Deliverables/Evidence:**
- Funnel drop-off analysis outputs
- EDA visualisations and written insights
- Updated notebook outputs and Git commits

---

### Week 4 — Predictive Model Development (Logistic Regression)
**Objective:** Build and evaluate a baseline abandonment prediction model.  
**Key Activities:**
- Pre-process data (encoding, feature selection, train-test split)
- Train logistic regression model for abandonment classification
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- Save model results and outputs for reporting

**Deliverables/Evidence:**
- Model training notebook
- Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix
- Stored results and Git commit evidence

---

### Week 5 — Model Interpretation & Factor Analysis
**Objective:** Explain model decisions and identify key drivers of abandonment.  
**Key Activities:**
- Extract model coefficients and interpret key features
- Identify high-impact predictors contributing to abandonment risk
- Translate technical findings into user/business-friendly explanations
- Prepare key insights to support recommendation development

**Deliverables/Evidence:**
- Coefficient / feature impact summary table
- Interpretation notes in notebook and report-ready format
- Git commits showing analysis updates

---

### Week 6 — UX Recommendation Mapping (Analytics → Actions)
**Objective:** Convert analytics insights into practical UX improvements.  
**Key Activities:**
- Map key abandonment factors to recommended UX improvements
- Create a UX recommendation backlog with prioritisation
- Align recommendations with expected impact on checkout success
- Document justification for each recommendation using evidence from analysis

**Deliverables/Evidence:**
- UX recommendation table/backlog
- Insight-to-solution mapping section
- Documentation added to report and GitHub repository

---

### Week 7 — Final Report Compilation & Viva Preparation
**Objective:** Finalise deliverables, documentation, and readiness to present outcomes.  
**Key Activities:**
- Consolidate all implementation results into the final report
- Complete reflection and contribution documentation (team-based)
- Final repository cleanup (structure, comments, final commits)
- Prepare viva-ready explanations and responses for key project decisions

**Deliverables/Evidence:**
- Final report with implementation and results
- Completed reflection/contribution statement
- Final GitHub repository with reproducible notebook outputs
- Viva preparation notes (summary of key questions and answers)

---

## Contribution & Tracking
All implementation progress, notebook versions, dataset updates, and documentation will be tracked via the GitHub repository with regular commits. Each team member will contribute consistently through assigned weekly tasks to demonstrate active participation and accountability.
